A password database that provides a REST API for storage of passwords and the verification of passwords, which use the most secure algorithms (e.g., Argon2) and practices known to date. It is intended to be used as a service which would be called from the backend of a login page. Multiple websites could use the service (each website would be a different account and have their own set of username-password pairs) to verify their user's passwords when they log in. There is no way to retrieve the username list nor passwords other than by brute force.  And so, this is NOT a password manager--you cannot retrieve the passwords later, only verify that the password you enter matches what is in the dictionary.
